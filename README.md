# scripts

## What

These are just some scripts I use and would like to be able to access from different places in a reliable place.

I wouldn't expect other people to use them but should you find them useful, feel free.

## Details

It may help to know, for myself in the future if I wake up forgetting everything, or for you reading this:

- These assume you have run `export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH` at some point (preferably by adding it to your `~/.zshrc` | `~/.bashrc` | `~/.profile`)
- They also might assume your username is `jay`
- Because that's mine.

## License

What license...there is none.

Public Domain

etc.
